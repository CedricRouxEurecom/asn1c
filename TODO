1. MAJOR:

1.1 Support for Information Object Classes. 
   Status:	with #99 fixed by @AuthenticEshkinKot I consider this is done.
		Need to check if Support for slicing the IOCs to produce "views"
		is there yet.

2. MEDIUM:

2.1 Support for EMBEDDED-PDV and CHARACTER STRING types.
	Requires something from 1.2 (Information Object Classes).
