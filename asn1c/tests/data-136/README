Mode of operation:

	Each of the *.in files is XER-decoded, then converted into UPER,
	then compared with the .uper file, then decoded back into XER
	and compared to the original .in file content.
	After that it is converted into APER then compared with the .aper file,
	then decoded back into XER and compared to the original .in file content

Naming conventions:

*-C.in  -       Comparison of .out might fail, but decoding succeeds
*-P.in  -       PER decoding of .out file must fail.
*-X.in	-	Final XER comparison must fail.
