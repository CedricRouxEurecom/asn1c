GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The 3GPP TS 25.413 version 14.0.0 Radio Access Network Application Part 
(RANAP) APER decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../ranap-14.0.0.asn1 file.

OBTAINING THE RANAP SPECIFICATION
================================

To obtain a different version of RANAP ASN.1 specification, you should go to
	http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36413.htm
and download any version of RANAP specification you like.

A .ZIP file with a Microsoft Word .DOC files will download shortly.

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from the chapter 9 of that .DOC file.
Be careful not to copy any preambles, chapter titles and other non-ASN.1 text.

ranap-dump USAGE
===============

The s1ap-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of a APER-encoded
RANAP protocol data unit. Since RANAP specification contains multiple PDUs,
a PDU must be selected manually using -p <PDU> command line option:

	./ranap-dump -iaper -p RANAP-PDU message.per

The list of recognized PDUs may be obtained using `-p list`.

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./ranap-dump -h
